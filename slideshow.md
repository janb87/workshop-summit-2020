# What is GraphQL?

<quote>GraphQL is a <strong>query language for APIs</strong> and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, <strong>gives clients the power</strong> to <strong>ask for exactly what they need</strong> and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables <strong>powerful developer tools</strong>.</quote>

# Small demo and takeaways

In general I like GraphQL a lot.

1. The development tooling is very nice (love the strongly typed capabilities)
2. If it is implemented properly the client can optimize it performance by running optimized queries on the database
3. Intellisense on GraphQL queries is so nice! 
4. Easy to keep server and client in sync with the strongly typed schemas.
